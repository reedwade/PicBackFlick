PicBackFlick -- my favourite Flickr back up utility so far

Features:
 - fetch recently changed (or all) images
 - collects some additional data about each photo
 - locally web browsable content store
 - suitable for running via cron long term to keep collection current


This is an early but highly functional Flickr backup utility. It works
fine for getting recently changed images and a small slice of the related
photo data. My intent is to expand this so that all related data is collected.


Not yet but in the works:
 - support for video
 - better html templates
 - store all photo data Flickr can provide
 - sets, collections, galleries
 - improve photo data storage scheme
 - several items noted inside the script (look for TODO)
 - etc


Quick Start Guide:

1- You'll need the Python Flickr API (previously known as "Beej's Python Flickr API")
   If you have a recent Debian / Ubuntu setup you should be able to install it via--
     sudo apt-get install python-flickrapi
   Otherwise, see the installation instructions at http://stuvel.eu/flickrapi

2- You need your own Flickr API key and secret, this only takes a moment from:
     http://www.flickr.com/services/api/keys/apply/
    
3- Set up your config file. picbackflick.py will create an example for you:

     bash$  ./picbackflick.py -d 3
     ~/.picbackflick.conf doesn't exist, a new one has been created for you which you must now edit

4- Do the trick. This will grab any photos updated in the last 3 days. 

     bash$  ./picbackflick.py -d 3
   
   The first time you run the application it will walk you through an authorisation step
   which is described here: http://stuvel.eu/media/flickrapi-docs/documentation/#authentication

5- Admire your efforts. Copy photos.html into ~/flickr_backups and view it in a web browser.
   (Make sure you're looking at the one in that directory.)
   You should see a thumbnail for each photo along with some other info.
   
Run the script with -h to see more options.


FILES:

 ~/.picbackflick.conf is the application config file
 ~/flickr_backups/img/ contain your photos
 ~/flickr_backups/info/ contains a pile of json style files, one per photo
 ~/flickr_backups/photo_db.js is all the json style files concatenated plus a little additional info
 ~/flickr_backups/last_updated is the timestamp of the last successful update


COPYING:

PicBackFlick is licensed under the AGPL instead of GPL because it's plausibly useful in a web
context.
